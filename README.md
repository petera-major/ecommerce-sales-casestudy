## Key Insights & Business Recommendations

**Product Performance**
- Top-selling products drove most of the revenue, but some categories had low or negative profit margins.
- Recommendation: Prioritize high-margin products in marketing and inventory decisions.

**Discounting Strategy**
- High discounts boosted sales volume but significantly reduced profitability.
- Recommendation: Refine discount policies — focus on targeted or seasonal discounts to protect margins.

**Customer Behavior**
- Repeat customers contributed over 60% of profits, despite being fewer in number.
- Recommendation: Launch loyalty programs and personalized marketing to retain this valuable segment.

**Regional Trends**
- The West region generated the highest sales but showed weaker margins compared to East and Central.
- Recommendation: Reassess regional pricing, logistics, or marketing spend in underperforming areas.
